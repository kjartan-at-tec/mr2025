 1. Determine the closed-loop transfer function $G_v(s)$ from \(v(t)\) to \(y(t)\) and the transfer function $G_n(t)$ from \(n(t)\) to \(y(t)\). 
 2. Show that if \(F_{fb}(s)\) and/or \(G(s)\) contains an integrator (pole in the origin), then \(G_v(0) = 0\) and \(G_n(0) = -1\). This means that constant disturbances are completely eliminated, but a constant measurement error (sensor bias) is passed unattenuated to the output. 

** The sensitivity function

\[ S(i\omega) = G_v(i\omega) = \frac{1}{ 1 + G_o(i\omega)} = \frac{1}{1 + G(i\omega)F_{fb}(i\omega)} \]


** Propagation of modelling errors / model variations
   Our model of the plant \(G(s)\) is never exact. Consider the true system written as
   \[ G^0(s) = G(s) + \Delta G(s). \]
   It is of interest to know how the modelling error \(\Delta G(s)\) propagates in our closed-loop system to give an error \(\Delta G_c(s)\)
   \[ G_c^0(s) = G_c(s) + \Delta G_c(s). \]

** Propagation of modelling errors, contd
   The closed-loop system is given by
   \[ G_c = \frac{GF_{ff}}{ 1 + G F_{fb}} \]
   and so the propagation of the modelling error is
   \[ \Delta G_c = \frac{\partial G_c}{\partial G} \Delta G. \]
   We can show that 
   \[ \frac{\partial G_c}{\partial G} = S(s)\frac{G_c(s)}{G(s)} \] so
   \[ \frac{\Delta G_c(s)}{G_c(s)} =  S(s) \frac{\Delta G(s)}{G(s)}. \]

** Propagation of modelling errors, contd
   Important conclusions from 
   \[ \frac{\Delta G_c(s)}{G_c(s)} =  S(s) \frac{\Delta G(s)}{G(s)}. \]
   1. For (low) frequencies where \(S(i\omega)\) (typically) is small, modelling errors or model variations have little effect on the closed-loop system.  
   2. The sensitivity \(S(i\omega)\) is typically designed to be small for low frequencies, but it should not be too large for frequencies where there are non-negligable modelling errors.
   3. The modelling error is typically worse for higher frequencies, so \(\Delta G(i\omega)\) is small for low freqencies and larger for higher frequencies.

** Interpretations of the sensitivity function
   Several important interpretations of the sensitivity function \(S(s)\)
   1. \(S(i\omega)\) tells us how well our closed-loop system attenuates disturbances of different frequencies
   2. Its maximum value is a measure of how close the closed-loop system is to being unstable.
   3. \(S(i\omega)\) tells us how modelling errors or modelling variations of the plant influences the closed-loop system

** An important limitation

\[ \int _{0}^{\infty }\ln |S(i\omega )|d\omega =\int _{0}^{\infty }\ln \left|{\frac {1}{1+G_o(i\omega )}}\right|d\omega =\pi \sum Re(p_{k})-{\frac {\pi }{2}}\lim _{s\rightarrow \infty}s G_o(s) \]
